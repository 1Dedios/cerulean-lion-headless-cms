<H1> Project Overview </>

  <p> Cerulean Lion is tasked with building a function headless CMS website, with a decoupled front-end and back-end. </p>
  
  
<H2> Tech Stack </H2>
  
  <P> Our tech stack consists of Figma/Sketch for design, Next.Js/React for frontend implementation, and Wordpress.com as our pseudo-backend. Wordpress.com is a managed hosting provider for Wordpress, an open-source CMS. We are utilizing Wordpress.com for simplicity because they have preconfigured REST API endpoints. </P>
  
  
<H3> Build Process </H3>
  <P> Our build process is simple. First, we design our site using a vector editor such as Figma/Sketch. Next, we handoff our design to our frontend dev team, who then use Next.Js to create components that render our site according to the design teams specifications. Since Wordpress.com manages the API endpoints as well as the database, there is not much backend implementation needed. </P>
